RETRIEVAL AUGMENTED GENERATION (RAG)
retrieval augmented generation (rag) is a cutting-edge NLP method that combines search and text generation 
for better results. First, it uses a search tool to find relevant information from a large document database 
based on your query. Then, a generation model like a Transformer based neural network , uses this information
to create a coherent and contextually appropriate response. This approach makes RAG great for tasks like 
question answering personalized content creation, complex problem-solving, as it ensures both accuracy and 
a deep understanding of the language
